QGIS webmap of November 6, 2018, precinct-by-precinct election results in partisan races in Kent County, Michigan. 

This app helps identify precincts more susceptible to down-ballot roll off specific to Democratic Kent County Commission (KCC) candidates by noting the differences in vote totals for races at the top of the ballot (ex. Governor) versus races at the bottom of the ballot (ex. County Commission).

In general, Democratic KCC candidates tended to lose votes down ballot while Republicans actually gained votes. In a year with a popular Democrat at the top of the ticket in Gretchen Whitmer, ballot roll-off can mean the difference between winning and losing in these important local elections. 

This app was used by 2020 Democratic Kent County Commission candidates in districts 6, 7, 8, 11, and 19.
